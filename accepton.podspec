  s.description      = <<-DESC
A swift library for processing payments through the AcceptOn API which elegantly unifies many payment providers including PayPal, Stripe, and ApplePay. This library provides you with powerful flexibility and ease-of-use by offering both beautiful pre-made payment views and access to the well-engineered low-level primitives for those wanting to have tighter integration into their applications.
