## Install via CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a convenient dependency manager for XCode projects. If you haven't already, you may install *CocoaPods*
with:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

> Make sure you have version 0.39.0 or higher. Run `pod --version` if you're unsure. You may update cocoapods by running `gem install cocoapods`.

Once you have installed *CocoaPods*, please put the following code into your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '8.0'
use_frameworks!

pod 'Accepton', '~> 0.2'
```

After you modify the `Podfile`, run `pod install` in the same directory as your modified `Podfile`.
