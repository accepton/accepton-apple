#What is this?
*accepton-apple* is a swift library for processing payments through the [AcceptOn](http://accepton.com) API which elegantly unifies many payment providers including [PayPal](http://paypal.com), [Stripe](http://stripe.com), and **ApplePay**.  This library provides you with powerful flexibility and ease-of-use by offering both beautiful pre-made payment views and access to the well-engineered low-level primitives for those wanting to have tighter integration into their applications.
