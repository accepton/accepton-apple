## What is this?
*accepton-apple* is a swift library for processing payments through the [AcceptOn](http://accepton.com) API which elegantly unifies many payment providers including [PayPal](http://paypal.com), [Stripe](http://stripe.com), and **ApplePay**.  This library provides you with powerful flexibility and ease-of-use by offering both beautiful pre-made payment views and access to the well-engineered low-level primitives for those wanting to have tighter integration into their applications.

## CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a convenient dependency manager for XCode projects. If you haven't already, you may install *CocoaPods*
with:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

> Make sure you have version 0.39.0 or higher. Run `pod --version` if you're unsure. You may update cocoapods by running `gem install cocoapods`.

Once you have installed *CocoaPods*, please put the following code into your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '8.0'
use_frameworks!

pod 'Accepton', '~> 0.1'
```

After you modify the `Podfile`, run `pod install` in the same directory as your modified `Podfile`.

### If you don't use CocoaPods, then:

1. Clone or download the SDK, which consists of header files, a static library. It also includes a sample app.
    * **As of version 2.12.0, the SDK requires Xcode 7 and iOS 8 SDK.**
2. Add the `PayPalMobile` directory (containing several .h files and libPayPalMobile.a) to your Xcode project. We recommend checking "Copy items..." and selecting "Create groups...".
3. (Optionally) Add the `CardIO` directory (containing several .h files, `libCardIO.a`, `libopencv_core.a`, and `libopencv_imgproc.a`) to your Xcode project. We recommend checking "Copy items..." and selecting "Create groups...". `libCardIO.a`, `libopencv_core.a`, and `libopencv_imgproc.a` adds the functionality to pay by scanning a card.
4. In your project's **Build Settings** (in the `TARGETS` section, not the `PROJECTS` section):
  * add `-lc++ -ObjC` to `Other Linker Flags`
  * enable `Enable Modules (C and Objective-C)`
  * enable `Link Frameworks Automatically`
5. In your project's **Build Phases**, link your project with these libraries. Weak linking for iOS versions back to 6.0 is supported.
  * `Accelerate.framework`
  * `AudioToolbox.framework`
  * `AVFoundation.framework`
  * `CoreLocation.framework`
  * `CoreMedia.framework`
  * `MessageUI.framework`
  * `MobileCoreServices.framework`
  * `SystemConfiguration.framework`
  * `SafariServices.framework`

## Usage
After choosing one of the above methods to install the Accepton iOS framework, there are two simple methods for getting started.j

## Low Level Primitives
You may create more customized solutions through using the lower level api's:

  * [AcceptOnAPI](./docs/AcceptOnAPI.md) - The raw low-level networking API to talk to *AcceptOn*
  * [AcceptOnUIMachine](./docs/AcceptOnUIMachine.md) - Handles the semantics of the UI

```swift
import accepton
```

## Libraries Used
  * [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/) - Elegant HTTP Networking in Swift
  * [SnapKit](http://snapkit.io) - An Autolayout DSL for iOS & OSX
  * [Stripe Payment Kit](https://github.com/stripe/PaymentKit) - Easily accept payments through stripe on iOS
  * [Paypal iOS SDK](https://github.com/paypal/PayPal-iOS-SDK) - See licensing restrictions
